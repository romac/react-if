# React-if Demo

This is a very simple demo application using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to verify that the library code works.

To run this demo application:

1. Build react-if by running `yarn build` in the root directory
2. Run `yarn start` in the demo directory
3. Parcel will now start a dev session and you can open it in your browser (by default on `localhost:1234`)
